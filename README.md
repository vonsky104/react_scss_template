This project is a simple approach to React and SCSS integration. 

Gulp and SCSS modules take care of styling, dist css is minified by npm build so its not neccessary to loose time by doing it with gulp.

This is simple project for my own use, but everyone can use it as well. If I will have some more time I will try to clean it and made some simple App with it just to show use of Redux and more. 

Cheers!
